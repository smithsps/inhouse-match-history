# In-House Match History

This project is a web application for tracking and displaying a log of League of Legends in-house matches. As these are custom matches, there is no great other way to track them via mainstream tracking websites.

- List and search all recorded matches
- Upload new ones
- Edit uploaded ones


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
